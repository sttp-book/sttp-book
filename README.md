# Software Testing: From Theory to Practice

Welcome to **Software Testing: From Theory to Practice**!

This book covers the most important testing techniques needed to build high-quality software systems. Specific topics covered are quality attributes, maintainability and testability, manual and exploratory testing, automated testing, DevOps, test adequacy, model-based testing, state-based testing, decision tables, reviews and inspections, design-by-contract, test-driven design, unit versus integration testing, mocks and stubs.

We expect readers to be able to:

* Create unit, integration, and system tests using current existing tools (i.e. JUnit, Mockito, and JaCoCo) that effectively test complex software systems.

* Derive test cases that deal with exceptional, corner, and bad weather cases by performing several different techniques (i.e. boundary analysis, state-based testing, decision tables)
as well as able to reflect on their limitations, when and when not to apply them in a given context.

* Measure and reflect on the efficiency of the developed test suites by means of different test adequacy metrics (i.e. line, branch, condition, MC/DC coverage).

* Design and implement testable software systems by means of architectural patterns such as dependency injection, and ports and adapters.

* Write maintainable test code by avoiding well-known test code smells (e.g. Assertion Roulette, Slow or Obscure Tests).

*Target audience:* first-year Computer Science students. Knowledge in programming is required. Code examples are in Java, although easily transferrable to other languages.
